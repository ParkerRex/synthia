# Synth Sylenth Lab Instrument Specification

Status: Draft v1 (research turn)

Purpose: Define a lab-built macOS/Ableton software instrument whose Phase 1 goal is to recreate the Sylenth1 vintage VST experience for modern AU/VST3 hosts, then extend it with AI-assisted sound and arpeggio generation and conversational sound editing.

## Normative Language

The key words `MUST`, `MUST NOT`, `REQUIRED`, `SHOULD`, `SHOULD NOT`, `RECOMMENDED`, `MAY`, and `OPTIONAL` in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

`Implementation-defined` means the behavior is part of the implementation contract, but this specification does not prescribe one universal policy. Implementations MUST document the selected behavior.

## Evidence Language

This specification separates product requirements from research confidence:

- `Observed` means the statement is grounded in vendor documentation, manuals, host documentation, or directly inspected local material.
- `Inferred` means the statement is a reasoned design conclusion from observed material.
- `Unknown` means the statement is unresolved and MUST NOT be treated as confirmed behavior.

The Phase 1 target is a Sylenth-level instrument experience, grounded in `Sylenth1Manual.pdf`, `research/sylenth1-screenshots/`, and `docs/modern-sylenth-baseline.md`. Older Strobe/pluck research remains supporting background for the current engine, not the product destination.

## 1. Problem Statement

Synth is a software instrument for producers, sound designers, and coding agents in a lab context. The product mission is to rebuild the Sylenth1-style virtual analog workflow that producers still love, make it run well on today's macOS/Ableton systems, and then add AI-native workflows that legacy VSTs never had.

The instrument solves these problems:

- Sylenth1 remains a favorite vintage VST workflow, but it is no longer an actively evolving modern macOS-first production dependency.
- Producers want the immediacy of the original Sylenth architecture: A/B parts, four oscillator slots, fast filter/envelope/modulation access, integrated arp/effects, and direct preset workflows.
- Modern users also expect richer modulation inspection, browser metadata, high-DPI UI behavior, deterministic host restore, and strong Ableton AU/VST3 proof.
- The next product leap is AI-assisted sound design: useful randomized patches, generated arpeggios/chord movement, reference-sound recreation, and natural-language edits.

The product boundary:

- Synth owns synthesis, modulation, preset state, host integration, rendering behavior, validation tools, UI/UX, AI-assisted generation, and conversational control.
- Synth does not own DAW arrangement, mastering chains, external sample libraries, or user-provided copyrighted reference audio outside local analysis and preset-generation workflows.
- Synth MAY include onboard FX and arpeggiator/chord-generation features, but the core synth MUST remain strong enough to validate without hiding weak oscillator/filter/envelope behavior behind effects.

Success means:

- The plugin loads and behaves correctly in Ableton Live on supported macOS systems as AU and VST3.
- A competent user recognizes the Phase 1 workflow as a faithful modern rebuild of the vintage Sylenth experience.
- A user can browse, edit, save, automate, and restore presets with the speed expected from a production VST.
- Phase 2 AI generation creates musically useful patches and arp/chord ideas as editable parameter state.
- Phase 3 conversational control can translate text and reference-sound intent into safe, reversible synth changes.
- The codebase remains testable, realtime-safe, and portable enough for future Windows/Linux plugin targets.

## 2. Goals and Non-Goals

### 2.1 Goals

- Phase 1: recreate the Sylenth-style virtual analog architecture and workflow as the main product baseline.
- Support A/B parts, four oscillator slots, per-slot voices/unison, tuning, detune, phase/retrigger/invert, pan/stereo spread, mixer, filters, modulation, arpeggiator, effects, preset banks, and performance controls.
- Keep the current oscillator stack, nonlinear filter, modulation, and validation harness as useful scaffolding until the Sylenth-level architecture replaces or absorbs them.
- Provide polyphonic, monophonic, legato, and unison voice modes.
- Provide per-voice amp envelope, mod envelope, LFO, ramp, glide, velocity glide, random-on-note, voice index, and unison index sources.
- Provide an 8-slot TransMod-style modulation layer where each slot routes one source, optionally scaled by another source, to many destinations.
- Implement semitone-domain pitch and filter-cutoff modulation.
- Implement a nonlinear OTA-cascade-style multimode filter with diode-feedback clipping behavior and drive/resonance interaction.
- Provide amp-stage waveshaping, voice pan, unison pan, and analog-style instability controls.
- Provide a compact production UI that reaches Sylenth-level speed while using a modern original visual system.
- Phase 2: add AI-assisted patch randomization, sound generation, chord movement, and arpeggio generation.
- Phase 3: add conversational VST control for text edits and reference-audio recreation workflows.
- Ship AU and VST3 plugin targets for macOS.
- Support Universal macOS binaries for Apple Silicon and Intel Macs.
- Provide a standalone target for validation and preset/render tooling.

### 2.2 Non-Goals

- Bit-identical binary emulation of any third-party plugin.
- Requiring a licensed Sylenth install at runtime.
- Shipping third-party factory presets, samples, marks, or product assets as Synth-owned content.
- Turning the product into a generic wavetable workstation before the Phase 1 Sylenth rebuild is complete.
- VST2 support in the first release.
- AAX support in the first release.
- Built-in DAW project templates.
- Cloud sync, accounts, copy protection, telemetry, or network services in v1.

- `Releasing`
  - Note-off received; amp envelope release active.
- `Stolen`
  - Voice selected for stealing and fading/reinitializing.
- `Draining`
  - Voice tail finishing after all notes off or panic.

Terminal behavior:

- Voice returns to `Idle` when amplitude and filter tail fall below threshold or a maximum drain timeout is reached.

### 7.3 Envelope States

- `Idle`
- `Attack`
- `Decay`
- `Sustain`
- `Release`

Rules:

- Note-on in retrigger mode restarts envelope from the configured retrigger policy.
- Note-on in legato mode MAY avoid retriggering selected envelopes.
- Release from any active stage moves to `Release`.

### 7.4 LFO Gate States

- `FreeRunning`
- `WaitingForGate`
- `Gated`
- `Released`

Rules:

- `PolyOn` resets phase on note-on.
- `Poly` gates while note is held.
- `Mono` uses global phase for all voices.
- `Song` follows transport/tempo and is not note-local.

### 7.5 Preset Lifecycle States

- `Discovered`
- `Parsed`
- `Validated`
- `Migrated`
- `Loaded`
- `Invalid`

### 7.6 Idempotency and Concurrency Rules

- Repeated all-notes-off and panic events MUST be idempotent.
- Host state restore MUST be atomic from the audio thread perspective.
- Preset load during audio playback MUST crossfade, suspend, or apply lock-free parameter handoff without unsafe locks.
- UI edits and host automation conflicts MUST resolve by latest timestamp/order supplied by host and parameter gesture semantics.
- Offline render with identical inputs MUST be deterministic within floating-point tolerance.

## 8. Interfaces and Contracts

### 8.1 User Interface Contract

- `TransMod`
  - Eight slots with source, scaler, destination depths, active modulation indicators.
- `Amp and Stereo`
  - Amp drive, level, pan, voice spread, unison spread, analog.
- `FX`

- `Diagnostics`
  - Sample rate, format, architecture, CPU estimate, active voices, oversampling, denormal/NaN guard counters in debug builds.

UI rules:

- The UI MUST NOT copy the white SH-101-like historical plugin look, Roland SH-101 panel, FXpansion Strobe UI, or any other protected trade dress.
- Controls SHOULD use compact, DAW-native visual language: knobs/sliders for continuous values, menus for modes, toggles for binary options, tabs for views, and clear modulation badges.
- Text MUST remain readable at all supported scales.
- Every control MUST have a host parameter or documented local-only state.
- Automation gestures MUST be correct for mouse, keyboard, and controller edits.

- User presets: user Music, Documents, or app support directory under an owned vendor/product path.
- Validation reports: repository `build/reports` or configured output directory.

### 10.3 Migrations

- Preset schema versions MUST be monotonic integers.
- Every schema migration MUST have unit tests.
- Public parameter IDs MUST not be renamed without migration aliases.
- Removed parameters MUST be ignored with warning or mapped to replacement behavior.

### 10.4 Retention and Deletion

- The plugin MUST NOT create large caches by default.
- Validation renders MAY be deleted by normal build cleanup.
- User preset deletion MUST require explicit user action.
- Factory preset updates MUST NOT delete user presets.

### 10.5 Audit History

- Runtime plugin use does not require audit history.

## 11. Integration Contracts

### 11.1 JUCE and CMake

Purpose: Build plugin formats from one C++ codebase.

Requirements:

- Use JUCE CMake plugin targets for AU, VST3, and standalone.
- VST2 MUST NOT be enabled unless a future explicit legacy requirement is accepted.
- AU target MUST use MusicDevice-style instrument behavior.
- Build files MUST keep plugin metadata centralized.

Current source: JUCE CMake API documents plugin `FORMATS` values including `Standalone`, `VST3`, `AU`, and others, and documents AU/VST3 copy directories and plugin metadata options: https://github.com/juce-framework/JUCE/blob/master/docs/CMake%20API.md

### 11.2 Ableton Live on macOS

Purpose: Primary host compatibility target.

Requirements:

- Validate in Ableton Live 11.3+ and Live 12 where available.
- AU and VST3 builds MUST be scanned and playable.
- Host automation MUST record and replay main parameters.
- Plugin state MUST save and restore inside Ableton Sets.
- Do not mix AU and VST3 instances of the same plugin in a single test set when validating host state.

Current source: Ableton documents macOS support for AU, VST2, and VST3, AUv2/AUv3 support as of Live 11.3, default system plugin folders, and Apple Silicon native plugin notes: https://help.ableton.com/hc/en-us/articles/209068929-Using-AU-and-VST-plug-ins-on-macOS

### 11.3 VST3 Format

Purpose: Cross-DAW plugin format.

Requirements:

- VST3 bundle MUST report correct category and factory information.
- VST3 output MUST be a macOS `.vst3` bundle.
- Universal binary packaging MUST be validated with `lipo` or equivalent.

Current source: Steinberg VST3 developer documentation describes macOS VST3 bundles and universal binary placement: https://steinbergmedia.github.io/vst3_dev_portal/pages/Technical%2BDocumentation/Locations%2BFormat/Plugin%2BFormat.html

### 11.4 Strobe/Strobe2 Reference Material

Purpose: Historical and architectural reference only.

Rules:

- Licensed Strobe v1/Strobe2 installs MAY be used for black-box measurement if legally available.
- Reference measurements MUST NOT involve decompilation or copying proprietary presets/assets.
- Strobe2 comparisons MUST be marked as non-identical lineage reference, because ROLI documents Strobe2 as not a drop-in replacement for Strobe v1.
- On Apple Silicon, Strobe2 native behavior MUST be treated cautiously because ROLI documents a native oscillator issue and recommends Rosetta for correct sound.

Current sources:

- FXpansion DCAM Synth Squad legacy/support FAQ: https://www.fxpansion.com/support/faq/dcamsynthsquad/
- FXpansion DCAM product page: https://www.fxpansion.com/products/dcamsynthsquad/
- ROLI Strobe2 FAQ: https://support.roli.com/support/solutions/articles/36000396689-strobe2-faqs
- ROLI Apple Silicon compatibility note: https://support.roli.com/support/solutions/articles/36000582347-cypher2-strobe2-compatibility-with-apple-silicon

## 12. Security, Privacy, and Safety

### 12.1 Clean-Room and Legal Safety

- Implementation MUST be original.
- Developers MUST NOT decompile, disassemble, patch, or inspect proprietary binaries for algorithmic extraction.
- Developers MUST NOT copy third-party presets, UI assets, manuals beyond fair-use notes, screenshots, product names, logos, or trade dress.
- Shipped UI and factory content MUST avoid unlicensed marks including `FXpansion`, `Strobe`, `ROLI`, `Roland`, `SH-101`, `Deadmau5`, and song titles unless legal approval exists.
- Internal research notes MAY cite sources and use third-party names for nominative reference.

### 12.2 Runtime Safety

- Audio thread MUST NOT perform file I/O, allocation, network calls, blocking locks, or synchronous logging.
- Plugin MUST sanitize NaN, infinity, denormals, and invalid parameter states.
- Output MUST be protected from runaway feedback through bounded resonance, clipping, or limiter-style safety in debug/validation paths.
- Panic action MUST silence active voices.

### 12.3 Privacy

- v1 MUST NOT send telemetry.
- v1 MUST NOT require an account.
- Debug logs MUST NOT include user file contents beyond paths and error classes unless explicitly enabled.

### 12.4 Supply Chain

- Third-party dependencies MUST be pinned or versioned.
- New dependencies MUST be reviewed for license compatibility with the intended distribution.
- Builds SHOULD produce reproducible metadata where practical.

## 13. Failure Model and Recovery Strategy

### 13.1 Failure Classes

- `host_scan_failure`
- `unsupported_architecture`
- `invalid_plugin_metadata`
- `preset_parse_error`
- `preset_migration_error`
- `midi_state_error`
- `voice_allocation_overflow`
- `cpu_overload`
- `nan_or_infinity_detected`
- `denormal_spike`
- `oversampling_reinit_failure`
- `filesystem_permission_error`
- `codesign_or_notarization_failure`

### 13.2 Recovery Behavior

- Host scan failure: expose validation target and logs to diagnose metadata, signing, or architecture.
- Invalid preset: reject load, keep current state, show error.
- CPU overload: degrade only through documented quality settings or voice stealing; never emit invalid samples.
- NaN/infinity: sanitize sample/block, increment diagnostic counter, fail debug validation.
- Denormal: apply denormal guards globally in DSP path.
- MIDI stuck note: all-notes-off and panic MUST recover.

### 13.3 Partial State Recovery

- Host state restore failure MUST leave plugin in a valid default state.
- Preset migration warnings MUST be visible in development diagnostics.
- Validation failures MUST preserve reports and render artifacts for inspection.

### 13.4 Operator Intervention Points

- User panic button.
- Preset reset to init.
- Rescan plugin in Ableton.
- Clear/rebuild preset index.
- Disable FX.
- Reduce quality/oversampling/polyphony.
- Run standalone diagnostic render.

## 14. Observability and Operations

Required development diagnostics:

- Active voice count.
- Peak/RMS output meter.
- MIDI event counters.
- NaN/infinity guard counter.
- Denormal guard counter if measurable.
- Current sample rate, block size, oversampling, format, architecture.
- CPU/render time estimate.
- Preset schema/migration warnings.
- Last plugin state restore result.

Required validation outputs:

- JSON report per render fixture.
- Audio render artifact for failed reference tests.
- FFT/metric summaries for oscillator and filter tests.
- Host smoke test logs.

Logging rules:

- Realtime thread MUST write only to lock-free counters or buffers.
- File logs MUST be development/diagnostic only unless user explicitly enables them.
- Release builds SHOULD keep diagnostics lightweight.

## 15. Performance, Capacity, and Limits

### 15.1 Realtime Targets

Targets are implementation-defined baselines and MUST be measured on at least one Apple Silicon and one Intel Mac if available.

Recommended targets:

- 48 kHz, 128-sample buffer, realtime 2x oversampling.
- 16 poly voices with 2 unison voices SHOULD run without dropouts on a current Apple Silicon Mac.
- 8 poly voices with 2 unison voices MUST run comfortably on the minimum supported Mac.
- UI repaint MUST NOT starve audio processing.
- Parameter automation at host control rates MUST NOT create zipper noise.

### 15.2 Audio Limits

- Polyphony hard maximum: at least 32 logical voices.
- Unison hard maximum: at least 8 voices per note.
- Stack hard maximum: at least 5 oscillator copies for v1 profile.
- Sample rates: 44.1, 48, 88.2, 96 kHz REQUIRED; 176.4 and 192 kHz RECOMMENDED.
- Block sizes: 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024 REQUIRED.
- Output should maintain headroom; factory presets SHOULD not clip at default velocity.

### 15.3 Degradation Behavior

- When voices exceed capacity, use configured stealing policy.
- When oversampling is too expensive, user MAY select lower quality; plugin MUST NOT silently reduce quality without visible state.
- Offline render MAY use higher quality than realtime if deterministic and documented.

## 16. Deployment and Host Lifecycle

### 16.1 Supported Environments

Required first release:

- macOS.
- Apple Silicon native.
- Intel native.
- Ableton Live 11.3+ and Live 12 validation.

Recommended:

- Logic Pro AU validation.
- Reaper VST3/AU validation.
- Bitwig VST3 validation.

### 16.2 Install Locations

Default macOS install locations SHOULD follow host conventions:

- AU: `/Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/Components/`
- VST3: `/Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/VST3/`

Per-user install locations MAY be supported:

- AU: `~/Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/Components/`
- VST3: `~/Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/VST3/`

### 16.3 Startup Sequence

1. Host loads plugin bundle.
2. Plugin initializes metadata and parameter registry.
3. Plugin creates default state.
4. Host calls prepare with sample rate/block size.
5. DSP allocates buffers and oversamplers off the audio path.
6. Processing starts.

### 16.4 Shutdown Sequence

1. Host stops processing or destroys instance.
2. Plugin releases voices and buffers.
3. UI closes safely.
4. No background worker threads remain.

### 16.5 Upgrade and Rollback

- New plugin versions MUST load old host states and presets through migration.
- Downgrade compatibility is not required unless explicitly documented.
- Public plugin IDs MUST remain stable across upgrades.

## 17. Reference Algorithms

### 17.1 Audio Block Processing

```text
function process_block(audio_out, midi_events, block_size):
  clear(audio_out)
  schedule_midi_events_by_sample_offset(midi_events)

  for sample_index in 0..block_size-1:
    handle_events_at(sample_index)
    update_global_modulators_if_needed()

    left = 0
    right = 0

    for voice in active_voices:
      update_voice_modulators(voice)
      frame = render_voice_sample(voice)
      left += frame.left
      right += frame.right

    frame = process_fx_if_enabled(left, right)
    audio_out.left[sample_index] = sanitize(frame.left)
    audio_out.right[sample_index] = sanitize(frame.right)
```

### 17.2 Voice Note-On

```text
function note_on(note, velocity, channel, sample_offset):
  allocated = allocator.allocate(note, velocity, channel)

  for voice in allocated:
    voice.state = Starting
    voice.midi_note = note
    voice.velocity = normalize_velocity(velocity)
    voice.random_on_note = seeded_random_bipolar()
    voice.voice_indices = compute_voice_indices(voice)
    voice.unison_indices = compute_unison_indices(voice)
    reset_or_continue_glide(voice)
    gate_amp_env(voice)
    gate_mod_env(voice)
    gate_lfo(voice)
    gate_ramp(voice)
    initialize_pan(voice)
```

### 17.3 Stack Detune

```text
function stack_detune_cents(index, count, detune_norm):
  if count == 1:
    return 0

  center = (count - 1) / 2
  spread = (index - center) / max(center, 1)
  shaped = pow(detune_norm, 2.2)
  return spread * max_detune_cents * shaped
```

### 17.4 Cutoff Computation

```text
function compute_cutoff_hz(voice):
  cutoff_semi =
    base_filter_cutoff_semi
    + direct_keytrack_depth * ((voice.midi_note - keytrack_root) / 12)
    + direct_lfo_depth_semi * voice.lfo.value
    + direct_mod_env_depth_semi * voice.mod_env.value
    + transmod_sum_for(filter_cutoff, voice)

  cutoff_hz = 440 * pow(2, (cutoff_semi - 69) / 12)
  return clamp(cutoff_hz, 8, 0.45 * oversampled_sample_rate)
```

### 17.5 TransMod Evaluation

```text
function transmod_sum_for(parameter_id, voice):
  total = 0

  for slot in transmod_slots:
    if not slot.enabled:
      continue

    source = eval_mod_source(slot.source, voice)
    scaler = 1

    if slot.scaler != None:
      scaler = eval_mod_source(slot.scaler, voice)

    total += slot.depths[parameter_id] * source * scaler

  return total
```

### 17.6 Nonlinear Filter Sketch

This sketch is not a claim about FXpansion internals. It is a conformant implementation direction for a nonlinear cascade with feedback clipping.

```text
function process_l4(input, cutoff_hz, resonance, drive):
  g = tan(pi * cutoff_hz / sample_rate)
  G = g / (1 + g)

  drive_gain = db_to_gain(max_drive_db * drive)
  resonance_effective = resonance / (1 + 0.65 * drive + 0.25 * drive * drive)
  feedback = 4 * resonance_effective * diode_clip(stage4)
  u = tanh(drive_gain * (input - feedback))

  stage1 = tpt_one_pole(u, stage1, G)
  stage2 = tpt_one_pole(stage1, stage2, G)
  stage3 = tpt_one_pole(stage2, stage3, G)
  stage4 = tpt_one_pole(stage3, stage4, G)

  return select_filter_output(mode, stage1, stage2, stage3, stage4)
```

### 17.7 Preset Migration

```text
function load_preset(json):
  parsed = parse_json(json)
  validate_top_level(parsed)

  while parsed.schema_version < current_schema_version:
    migration = migrations[parsed.schema_version]
    parsed = migration(parsed)

  validate_parameters(parsed.parameters)
  validate_mod_slots(parsed.mod_slots)
  return atomic_plugin_state(parsed)

## Appendix B. Historical Research Source Map

Observed current/vendor facts:

- FXpansion documents DCAM Synth Squad as a legacy product and describes Strobe as a fast performance synth with single-oscillator architecture, polyphony, TransMod, parallel waveforms, oscillator stacking, and many filter modes: https://www.fxpansion.com/products/dcamsynthsquad/
- FXpansion support documents DCAM Synth Squad as legacy/superseded by Strobe2 and no longer actively tested/developed: https://www.fxpansion.com/support/faq/dcamsynthsquad/
- ROLI documents Strobe2 as inspired by SH-101, OB-1, and Pro-One, with single super-oscillator, stacked detuned copies, TransMod, built-in effects, and 16 TransMod slots as a Strobe2 feature: https://support.roli.com/support/solutions/articles/36000396689-strobe2-faqs
- ROLI documents Strobe2 as not a drop-in replacement for Strobe v1 and notes synthesis-engine differences for imported v1 presets: https://support.roli.com/support/solutions/articles/36000396689-strobe2-faqs
- ROLI documents Strobe2/Cypher2 Universal Binaries and an Apple Silicon native oscillator issue with Rosetta recommended for correct sound: https://support.roli.com/support/solutions/articles/36000582347-cypher2-strobe2-compatibility-with-apple-silicon
- Ableton documents macOS AU/VST/VST3 support and plugin install folders: https://help.ableton.com/hc/en-us/articles/209068929-Using-AU-and-VST-plug-ins-on-macOS
- JUCE CMake documentation lists plugin target formats including Standalone, VST3, and AU: https://github.com/juce-framework/JUCE/blob/master/docs/CMake%20API.md
- Steinberg VST3 documentation describes `.vst3` macOS bundles and universal binary placement: https://steinbergmedia.github.io/vst3_dev_portal/pages/Technical%2BDocumentation/Locations%2BFormat/Plugin%2BFormat.html

Observed manual-derived architecture facts from the supplied research brief:

- Strobe v1 manual material describes Strobe as a single-oscillator analog-modelled performance synth inspired by Roland SH-series instruments, especially SH-09/SH-101, plus OB-1 and Pro-One.
- Strobe oscillator material describes stack/detune, saw/pulse/noise, sub oscillator waveforms, hard sync, pulse width, and direct modulation.
- Strobe filter material describes an OTA cascaded core with diode clipping in the feedback path, semitone cutoff, self-oscillation, drive/resonance interaction, and many multimode responses.
- Strobe amp material describes amp overload/waveshaping, voice pan modulation, level, and an analog instability control.
- Strobe modulation material describes gateable modulators, LFO sync/Hz modes, phase reset on gating, mono versus per-voice behavior, TransMod, glide, velocity glide, voice/unison sources, and modulation scaling.

Inferred target:

- The target sound should prioritize per-voice retriggered modulation, semitone cutoff movement, nonlinear filter drive, and voice/unison variation rather than wavetable synthesis or a generic monophonic SH-101 clone.

Unknowns:

- Exact historical binary identity.
- Exact preset values.
- Exact filter mode used on canonical references.
- Exact external effects chain.
- Any private parameter scaling or custom modifications.
