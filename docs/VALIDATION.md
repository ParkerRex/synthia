# Validation Plan

Validation must prove the instrument behaves correctly as a plugin and as a sound engine. Passing unit tests alone is not enough; Ableton loading, host state, and audio renders are required.

## Roadmap Validation Phases

Phase 1 validation proves the Sylenth rebuild: AU/VST3 scan/load/play in Ableton, host state restore, automation, preset browsing, A/B architecture, oscillator/filter/envelope/modulation behavior, arpeggiator timing, FX tails, UI open/close while playing, and screenshot/manual QA against `docs/modern-synthia-baseline.md`.

Phase 2 validation proves AI-assisted generation: randomize/generate commands must produce finite audio, valid preset state, bounded parameter values, deterministic or intentionally seeded results, and editable arp/chord/modulation data rather than opaque output.

Phase 3 validation proves conversational editing: text prompts and reference-sound workflows must produce reversible parameter diffs, preserve realtime safety, avoid invalid states, and include reports that explain which synth, modulation, arp, and FX controls changed.

The current smoke render is intentionally note-less and proves initialization, finite output, report writing, and command shape.

The current contract validation proves:

- 346 unique parameter IDs,
- valid defaults and ranges,
- APVTS state round-trip,
- old host-state default merge for new layer, oscillator-slot, arp, step, and chord fields,
- layer and oscillator-slot defaults, arp/chord defaults, legacy preset defaulting, saved preset serialization, inactive-slot no-op behavior, audible A2/B1/B2 rendering, and layer mute/solo behavior,
- seven factory preset JSON files, including six curated Phase 1 patch-recreation cases,
- no unknown preset parameter IDs,
- TransMod slot objects use valid slot IDs, source/scaler choices, depth domains, and destination IDs.
- Init, Reset, and seedable Randomize commands prepare ordinary APVTS state without mutating live state before replacement.
- Preset workflow helpers cover metadata-aware writes, no-clobber create-only safe-save rejection, dirty-state comparison against immutable baseline fingerprints, and local A/B compare slot capture/recall without mutating live state before replacement.
- Standalone UI smoke covers the preset workflow and metadata-save controls at normal and compact sizes: dirty-state pill, Init, Random, Reset, A Store/A Load, B Store/B Load, Preset name, Author, Bank, Category, Tags, Notes, Save New, Overwrite, and the adjacent preset browser/MIDI panels. The A Store manual control smoke confirms A Load becomes actionable after capture. Invalid-preset browser rows are model-backed in the editor and require manual browser-bottom QA until JUCE viewport scrolling is reliable under automation.
- MIDI controller-map normalization rejects invalid assignments, resolves CC/parameter conflicts deterministically, and round-trips through the global user sidecar JSON shape.

The current voice-core validation proves:

- envelope attack/release behavior,
- LFO phase reset,
- poly voice allocation and release,
- engine note-on/note-off voice lifecycle,
- audio render remains finite while voices are active.

The current DSP validation proves:

- oscillator tuning for C1, C3, C5, and C7 within the 5-cent target,
- high-band oscillator spectral metrics are recorded for C1, C3, C5, and C7,
- pulse duty cycle at 10, 25, 50, 75, and 90 percent widths,
- sub octave accuracy for -1, -2, and -3,
- deterministic noise, stack detune symmetry, and hard-sync finite output,
- semitone filter cutoff mapping,
- nonlinear filter mode response for L2, L4, B2, B4, H2, H4, Peak2, Notch2, and Notch4,
- finite resonant impulse behavior,
- drive changes filter response,
- `Pluck Core 01` dry render loads the requested preset and MIDI fixture, writes a finite non-clipping WAV/report, and records note-local LFO spread during overlapping notes.
- ramp timing, glide, velocity glide, direct keytrack/LFO/envelope routes, TransMod scaler multiplication to many physical destinations, performance MIDI sources, voice/unison/random source spread, and fixture trace ranges.
- direct chord expansion, overlapping chord-output release ownership, chord parameter-change note-off symmetry, arp up-mode timing, host-tempo step duration, gate-off timing, octave wrapping, step pitch and velocity scaling, tie/hold behavior, arp enable/disable while input notes are held, hold-disable latch clearing, and panic clearing generated notes.
- voice-mode and polyphony cap changes keep the most recent held notes and drain surplus voices through a bounded de-click fade instead of hard-resetting them.
- top-level `mod_slots` preset schema objects are applied by render loading, including schema-only modulation fixtures that omit flat APVTS-style `transmod.*` parameters.
- modulation route model catalogs and derived route rows are covered by `SynthiaContractTest`, including source/scaler IDs, destination IDs, active route filtering, and legacy `transmod.N.depth` cutoff contribution.
- `SynthiaRender --modulation-route-render-test` compiles a route write through `ModulationRouteModel`, applies it to `transmod.3.*`, proves the rendered audio changes, then applies a clear-slot edit and proves the render returns to baseline within deterministic tolerances.
- preset browser metadata validation, saved user preset browser metadata, factory/user/legacy source summaries, sidecar favorite add/remove behavior, search/category/tag/favorite filtering, and browser catalog facets are covered by `SynthiaContractTest`.
- APVTS automation-readiness is covered by `SynthiaContractTest`: every registry parameter must be exposed by APVTS, remain host-automatable when marked automatable, match its declared float/bool/choice type, and accept host-notifying default writes. Ableton AU/VST3 automation record/playback is covered by the 2026-06-07 host proof in `docs/host-validation/ableton-smoke.md`.
- MIDI controller-map persistence is covered by `SynthiaContractTest`; learned CC capture, persistence, value application, and Forget behavior in AU and VST3 are covered by the current Ableton host proof in `docs/host-validation/ableton-smoke.md`.
- FX bypass stays null-equivalent to dry rendering when globally bypassed, disabled expanded-rack modules are dry-equivalent, phaser/EQ/compressor/distortion-mode processing is finite and measurably audible when enabled, tempo-synced delay reports exact sample timing at test tempo, FX tail length is reported from the active time-based FX parameters, and wet output remains finite, non-clipping, and measurably different from its dry reference.
- `SynthiaRender --offline-realtime-compare-test` renders `FX Space 01` in realtime Normal quality and offline High quality, verifies both renders are finite and non-clipping, and records a bounded meaningful audio difference caused by the quality-mode switch. Ableton offline bounce versus realtime resampling is covered by the 2026-06-07 host proof in `docs/host-validation/ableton-smoke.md` and the stronger `scripts/compare-ableton-bounce-realtime.py` content-match report.
- `SynthiaRender --randomize-test` prepares seedable bounded randomized APVTS state through `PresetManager`, renders each seed through the standalone engine as prepared, rejects malformed seed lists, and checks finite non-silent non-clipping output.
- `SynthiaRender --suite core` runs the standalone smoke, parameter, preset, voice, oscillator, filter, modulation, modulation route render, offline/realtime compare, randomize render, dry pluck, wet pluck, LFO ablation, and determinism reports in one command.
- `SynthiaRender --suite patch-recreation` renders `Pluck Core 01`, `Supersaw Stack 01`, `Bass Wub 01`, `Pad Wide 01`, `Arp Motion 01`, and `FX Space 01` against the overlap-pluck fixture, writes WAV/report artifacts for each, and checks finite non-clipping output plus meaningful wet-versus-dry FX differences. The arp/chord patch also asserts that `SynthRender` applies preset-loaded `arp.*` and `chord.*` state.
- `SynthiaRenderCoreSuite` runs the core suite under CTest.
- `SynthiaRandomizeRenderTest` runs the randomized preset render proof under CTest.
- `SynthiaModulationRouteRenderTest` runs the modulation route write/render/clear proof under CTest.
- `SynthiaOfflineRealtimeCompareTest` runs the standalone realtime/offline quality-mode comparison under CTest.
- `SynthiaPatchRecreationSuite` runs the patch-recreation suite under CTest.

Preset render validation is expected to fail if the preset file is missing, the preset JSON is invalid, the MIDI fixture is missing, the fixture is not a valid MIDI file, or the fixture has no note events.

## Validation Profiles

### Core DSP

- oscillator aliasing,
- pulse duty cycle,
- sub oscillator tuning,
- stack detune symmetry,
- filter cutoff mapping,
- filter drive/resonance behavior,
- envelope timing,
- LFO sync and phase reset,
- per-voice modulation independence,
- TransMod source/scaler/destination behavior.

### Musical Render

Use fixed MIDI fixtures:

- 128 BPM,
- overlapping 1/8 and 1/16 pluck phrase,
- velocity variation from 70 to 120,

- per-voice-LFO render.

Required checks:

- overlapping notes keep note-local cutoff motion in per-voice mode,
- mono LFO produces a measurably different movement profile,
- output is deterministic within tolerance,
- factory pluck does not clip at default level.

Current standalone core-suite artifacts:

- `summary.json`: aggregate pass/fail for all core reports.
- `pluck-core-01-dry.json`: dry factory pluck metrics plus WAV artifact path.
- `pluck-core-01-wet.json`: wet factory pluck metrics plus WAV artifact path, FX mode, delay division, tempo-synced delay samples, tail length, post-event render length, active quality mode, and wet-versus-dry difference metrics.
- `randomize.json`: seed list, per-seed prepared/rendered status, prepared FX-enabled state, peak, RMS, nonzero sample count, invalid sample count, and pass/fail for bounded randomized state render proof.
- `modulation-route-render.json`: route write edits, clear-slot edits, active route count, baseline/routed/cleared peak and RMS, routed audio-difference thresholds, clear-to-baseline tolerances, and pass/fail for route creation plus clear-slot restore.
- `offline-realtime-compare.json`: realtime/offline quality modes, peak/RMS metrics for each render, audio-difference metrics, and pass/fail for bounded meaningful quality-mode difference.
- `lfo-ablation.json`: compares per-voice LFO and mono LFO renders using note-local LFO spread and audio difference.
- `determinism.json`: renders the dry pluck twice and compares `max_abs_diff`, `rms_diff`, and `peak_delta` against fixed tolerances.
- `artifacts/*.wav`: retained dry/per-voice/mono render WAVs.
- `failures/*.wav`: written only when deterministic repeat comparison fails.

Current patch-recreation-suite artifacts:

- `summary.json`: aggregate pass/fail for the curated Phase 1 patch set.
- `<preset-id>-wet.json`: per-preset render metrics, FX mode, quality mode, note-local LFO spread where applicable, and wet-versus-dry difference metrics.
- `summary.json` patch rows include `arp_chord_state_passed`; this must be `true` for `Arp Motion 01`.
- `artifacts/<preset-id>-wet.wav`: retained render WAVs for listening and regression inspection.

### Host Integration

Required Ableton checks:

- AU scan/load/play,
- VST3 scan/load/play,
- parameter automation record/playback,
- host state save/restore,
- offline bounce versus realtime render,
- buffer-size changes,
- sample-rate changes,
- transport stop and all-notes-off,
- UI open/close while playing.
- MIDI Learn and Forget from the global controller panel, plus mapped CC playback against at least one continuous and one stepped parameter.

Current Ableton proof includes AU/VST3 `Layer A Level` automation record/playback plus Master offline bounce versus realtime resampling content comparison with envelope alignment, per-channel filtered-band correlation thresholds, and negative controls. Strict waveform/null-test equivalence is not claimed.

Recommended additional hosts:

- Logic Pro for AU,
- Reaper for AU/VST3,
- Bitwig Studio for VST3.

### Performance

Measure:

- 44.1, 48, 96 kHz,
- 32, 64, 128, 512 sample buffers,
- 8, 16, 32 voices,
- unison 1, 2, 4, 8,
- oversampling off, 2x, 4x,
- UI open and closed,
- silence/release-tail denormal behavior.

## Metrics

Recommended targets:

- oscillator tuning: within 5 cents,
- self-osc filter tracking: within 10 cents after calibration,
- LFO sync period: within 1%,
- envelope decay/release timing: within 15%,
- regression loudness after gain match: within 0.5 LU,
- no NaN or infinity in any render,
- no denormal CPU spike on silence tails.

Implemented standalone metrics:

- `invalid_samples`: finite-output guard; must be `0`.
- `peak`: maximum absolute sample; dry pluck must remain below `1.0`.
- `rms`: linear RMS of stereo audio.
- `rms_dbfs`: `20 * log10(rms)`, used as a lightweight loudness proxy until LUFS exists.
- `crest_db`: peak-to-RMS relationship.
- `dc_offset`: average mono offset.
- `spectral_centroid_hz`: bounded-window DFT centroid for coarse spectral regression.
- `stereo_correlation`: left/right correlation, useful for spread regressions.
- `note_local_lfo_spread`: spread of per-voice LFO values while notes overlap.
- `fx_mode`, `delay_division_beats`, `tempo_synced_delay_samples`, `fx_tail_seconds`, `post_last_event_seconds`, `quality_mode`, `wet_dry_max_abs_diff`, `wet_dry_rms_diff`, and `wet_meaningful_passed`: wet-render proof for the onboard fixed-order FX path.
- `mod_slot_schema_passed`: modulation harness check that canonical preset `mod_slots` objects are loaded into runtime TransMod slots.
- `routed_max_abs_diff`, `routed_rms_diff`, `cleared_max_abs_diff`, and `cleared_rms_diff`: modulation route render proof metrics for created-route audibility and clear-slot determinism.
- `realtime_quality_mode`, `offline_quality_mode`, `quality_modes_differ`, `difference_meaningful`, and `difference_bounded`: standalone realtime/offline quality comparison fields.
- `max_abs_diff`, `rms_diff`, `peak_delta`: deterministic repeat comparison metrics.

## Render Artifact Contract

Each validation render should record:

- fixture ID,
- preset ID,
- plugin version,
- sample rate,
- block size,
- tempo,
- seed,
- architecture,
- format or standalone runner,
- metric results,
- pass/fail summary.

Current report schema uses `schema_version: 1` and a per-report `suite` field. Core-suite reports live under the supplied output directory and are disposable build artifacts.

Failed renders should keep audio artifacts and JSON reports for inspection.

## First Validation Milestone

The first implementation milestone is not complete until:

- standalone renders the factory pluck fixture,
- oscillator/filter/envelope/LFO tests pass,
- AU loads in Ableton,
- VST3 loads in Ableton,
- Ableton state restore preserves the preset,
- per-voice LFO ablation test passes.
