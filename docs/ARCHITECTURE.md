# Architecture

sylenth-ai is planned as a JUCE/CMake C++ instrument with AU, VST3, and standalone targets.

## Product Phases

Phase 1 rebuilds the Sylenth-style virtual analog instrument workflow for modern macOS/Ableton AU and VST3 use. The current single-core pluck engine is scaffolding toward a fuller A/B architecture, four oscillator slots, Sylenth-level preset/arp/effects workflow, and a modern original UI.

Phase 2 adds AI-assisted sound and arpeggio creation. Generated patches, chord movement, and arp ideas must compile down to ordinary editable parameters, presets, modulation routes, and sequencer state.

Phase 3 adds conversational VST control. Text requests and reference-sound analysis should produce reversible parameter, modulation, arp, and FX edits without touching the realtime audio thread.

Current scaffold:

- `CMakeLists.txt` configures JUCE `8.0.13` through CMake `FetchContent`, unless `SYLENTH_AI_JUCE_PATH` points at a local checkout.
- `SylenthAIPlugin` builds shared plugin code plus AU, VST3, and Standalone formats with host-facing product name `sylenth-ai`.
- `SylenthAIRender` is the command-line validation executable.
- `SylenthAISmokeTest` is the first CTest target.
- `SylenthAIContractTest` validates parameter registry, layer/oscillator-slot defaults, preset files, MIDI controller-map persistence, and APVTS state round-trip.
- `SylenthAIVoiceCoreTest` validates envelope, LFO reset, voice allocation, and engine note release.
- `SylenthAIDspCoreTest` validates oscillator, filter, arp/chord scheduling, ramp, glide, velocity glide, direct routes, TransMod scalers, voice/unison/random/performance modulation sources, layer slot rendering, and FX bypass, delay/tail, panic-clear, and reverb-state safety.
- `SylenthAIRenderCoreSuite` runs the standalone core render harness and writes disposable JSON/WAV artifacts under `build/reports/ctest-core`, including dry and wet factory pluck reports.

## Realtime Boundary

The audio thread may:

- read atomically published parameter state,
- process MIDI events,
- render DSP,
- update lock-free diagnostic counters,
- write output buffers.

The audio thread must not:

- allocate memory,
- block on locks,
- perform file or network I/O,
- call synchronous logging,
- parse presets,
- rebuild UI,
- scan directories,
- create or destroy heavyweight resources.

## Parameter Strategy

Parameter IDs must be stable after public release. UI labels may change; IDs should not.

Recommended ID style:

- `voice.mode`
- `osc.stack_count`
- `osc.saw_level`
- `filter.cutoff_semitones`
- `direct.filter_lfo_semitones`
- `transmod.1.source`
- `macro.motion`

Each parameter needs:

- default,
- physical range,
- normalized conversion,
- display conversion,
- automation flag,
- smoothing policy,
- preset serialization flag.

Current registry status:

- 346 parameter IDs.
- Voice, A/B layer state, four oscillator-slot state, legacy oscillator, filter, amp, envelopes, LFO, ramp, arp/step/chord state, direct modulation, fixed-order FX rack state, realtime/offline quality modes, macros, and eight TransMod-style slots with physical destination depths are represented.
- Host state uses `AudioProcessorValueTreeState` with schema metadata.
- `ModulationRouteModel` exposes a non-realtime source catalog, destination catalog, route view, and write adapter over the existing TransMod slots. It is the model for future source tiles, halos, matrix rows, validation reports, and AI edit summaries; the audio thread still consumes the fixed `SynthParameters::transMod` snapshot.

Current editor and preset status:

- `PluginEditor` is a compact, fixed-shell control surface modeled on the Sylenth workflow: a header (preset prev/next/load/save/duplicate, output meter, active/max voices, model-backed patch-load estimate, panic, and an always-visible SR/block/peak/MIDI/invalid/architecture diagnostics footer), a persistent Layer A/B selector exposing the `layer.*` mix state, and a `Sound` / `Modulation` / `Effects` tabbed workspace. The `Sound` tab exposes a preset browser drawer, a compact global MIDI Learn panel, the live core controls, and a scrollable APVTS-bound arp/step/chord sequencer row; `Modulation` holds the destination-grouped direct routes plus the eight TransMod slots and a read-only route overview; `Effects` exposes the fixed-order rack modules with master/quality. Controls are drawn with an original rotary/switch/combo look and grid-packed into stable cells with formatted value readouts. Render-boundary honesty is encoded in the UI: Layer A oscillator 1 remains the legacy flat `osc.*` compatibility source and is badged `LIVE`; A2/B1/B2, layer mix controls, arp/step/chord controls, and FX rack controls bind to real state.
- Editor controls are constructed against `ParameterRegistry` IDs and use APVTS attachments for sliders, combo boxes, and toggles so UI edits reach the same host-automatable parameters as presets and host state.
- `PresetManager` scans bundled factory presets with a source-directory development fallback, scans user presets from `~/Music/ParkerX/sylenth-ai/Presets`, also reads legacy `~/Music/ParkerX/Synth/Presets` presets during the rename transition, validates preset JSON before load, prepares defaults-plus-overrides APVTS state for one-shot replacement, maps canonical `mod_slots` objects into flat TransMod parameters, writes schema-valid user preset JSON, and exposes browser-facing summaries with source, bank, category, tags, favorite keys, sidecar favorite state, search/filter helpers, and catalog facets.
- `MidiControllerMap` reads and writes the global user CC sidecar at `~/Music/ParkerX/sylenth-ai/MidiControllerMap.json`. `PluginProcessor` loads it on the message/control path, publishes fixed atomic CC-to-parameter indexes for audio-thread MIDI lookup, captures MIDI Learn events through atomics, and applies mapped CC values to APVTS parameters from its message-thread timer. The audio thread never writes the sidecar, locks the map, or mutates APVTS parameters directly.
- Processor diagnostics expose sample rate, block size, active voices, model-backed patch cost, MIDI event count, invalid sample count, peak, current preset, and binary architecture to the editor without filesystem or UI work on the audio thread.

Current layer and oscillator-slot status:

- `SynthParameters` has two `LayerParameters` records and two `LayerOscillatorParameters` records per layer: A1, A2, B1, and B2.
- Layer A defaults are enabled; Layer B defaults are disabled.
- Layer A oscillator 1 defaults to the primary enabled slot with one saw voice at full level. The other three slots default disabled with zero voices.
- `PluginProcessor` caches the namespaced `layer.*` atomics and publishes them into the realtime parameter snapshot.
- `SynthEngine::setParameters` clamps the layer and slot state at the audio boundary.
- Current audio rendering uses Layer A/B mix state and A1/A2/B1/B2 oscillator slots. Layer A oscillator 1 remains the compatibility gate for the legacy flat `osc.*` source; A2/B1/B2 render through preallocated oscillator stacks mapped from `layer.N.osc.M.*`. One filter, envelope pair, amp, modulation, and FX path are still shared until the later per-layer filter/envelope slice.

Current voice-core status:

- `SynthEngine` consumes note-on, note-off, all-notes-off, and all-sound-off from the plugin processor.
- `VoiceAllocator` supports basic poly allocation, note release, panic, and deterministic random-on-note values.
- `Envelope` and `Lfo` provide deterministic per-voice modulation primitives.
- `OscillatorStack` renders polyBLEP saw/pulse, deterministic noise, sub waveforms, stack detune, and hard sync.
- `Filter` renders semitone-domain L2/L4/B2/B4/H2/H4/Peak2/Notch2/Notch4 nonlinear responses with drive/resonance compensation and interpolated oversampling sub-steps.
- `Voice` applies direct pitch/pulse/cutoff routes, ramp, glide, velocity glide, TransMod scalers, synced or Hz LFO rates, per-voice/mono LFO behavior, amp envelope, amp drive, level, pan spread, unison spread, analog variation, performance MIDI sources, and macro influence.
- `ModulationRouteModel` translates enabled TransMod slots into explicit route summaries with source/scaler IDs, destination IDs, physical depth parameters, and legacy `transmod.N.depth` cutoff-depth visibility. Its write adapter compiles source/destination/depth requests back into existing `transmod.N.*` APVTS parameters, including deterministic clear-slot edits. `SynthAudioProcessor::getModulationRouteView()`, `writeModulationRoute()`, and `clearModulationSlot()` expose this model to the editor without adding hidden UI-only state.
- `Arpeggiator` keeps fixed-size held-note, step, and chord candidate state. `SynthEngine` also tracks physical MIDI input notes in fixed arrays so held notes can move deterministically between direct and arp routing when `arp.enabled` changes. When `arp.enabled` is true, external MIDI notes become held input state and generated note events feed the existing `VoiceAllocator`. When `chord.enabled` is true with arp off, direct note-on captures the generated chord outputs for that source note and deduplicates overlapping output pitches. Direct note-off releases the captured outputs, and chord parameter changes release stale chord outputs before rebuilding still-held physical input notes under the new chord configuration. The scheduler uses host tempo from `SynthParameters::tempoBpm`, fixed arrays, and no audio-thread allocation.
- `FxChain` applies a fixed post-voice rack: distortion/saturation, phaser, chorus/flanger-style modulation, simple EQ, tempo-synced delay, simple reverb, and compressor. Delay, chorus, phaser, EQ, and reverb state is prepared or reset outside allocation-sensitive processing; `process` performs no heap allocation. `quality.realtime_mode` and `quality.offline_mode` select conservative processing variations without changing audio-thread resource allocation.
- `SylenthAIRender` can write oscillator, filter, modulation, voice, preset validation, dry-core factory pluck, wet factory pluck, LFO ablation, determinism, and core-suite summary reports using the requested preset and MIDI fixture.

## DSP Priorities

Highest priority:

- Phase 1 Sylenth rebuild roadmap and Ableton AU/VST3 proof.
- Per-layer filters/envelopes, layer mixer/master polish, and deeper oscillator-slot parity on top of the delivered layer/slot renderer.
- Preset browser, fine-grained step/arp UI, effects, and modulation UX that support the Sylenth-level workflow.

Lower priority:

- Phase 2 AI generation,
- Phase 3 conversational/reference-sound editing,
- extended modulation processors beyond the Phase 1 workflow.
